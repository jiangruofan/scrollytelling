            <div class="title">Benefits of Community Trees & Forests</div>
            Community trees and forests are valuable. To the more than 76% of the United
       States population that now live in urban and suburban areas, trees provide many goods
and services. Values are realized by people who own trees, by people nearby, and by
society in general. People plant, maintain, conserve, and covet trees because of the
values and benefits generated.

            <div class="title">Pollution Reduction</div>
            Community forests cleanse the air by intercepting and slowing particulate materials causing them to fall out, 
            and by absorbing pollutant gases on surfaces & through uptake onto inner leaf surfaces.  <br /><br />
            Removal of particulates amounts to 9% across deciduous trees and 13% across evergreen trees. Pollen and mold spore,
             are part of a living system and produced in tree areas, but trees also sweep out of the air large amounts of these particulates.

            <div class="title">Carbon Dioxide Reduction</div>
            Approximately 800 million tons of carbon are currently stored in US community forests with 6.5 million tons per year increase in storage ($22 billion equivalent in control costs).
            <br /><br />
            A single tree stores on average 13 pounds of carbon annually.
            <br /><br />
            A community forest can store 2.6 tons of carbon per acre per year.
            <br /><br />
            We can also see from the chart that planting tree has the best effect on removing CO2.

            <div class="title">Water Run-Off</div>
7% of winter precipitation intercepted and evaporated by deciduous trees. <br /> <br />
22% of winter precipitation intercepted and evaporated by evergreen trees. <br /> <br />
18% of growing season precipitation intercepted and evaporated by all trees. <br /> <br />
For every 5% of tree cover area added to a community, run-off is reduced by approximately 2% 7% volume reduction in six-hour storm flow by community tree canopies. <br /> <br />
17% (11.3 million gallons) run-off reduction from a twelve-hour storm with tree canopies in a medium-sized city ($226,000 avoided run-off water control costs).

            <div class="title">Noise Reduction</div>
            A noisy environment jeopardizes peace and makes people feel awful. It is also regarded as a form of environmental pollution and is also a health concern. Lucky for us,
             we have millions of trees, the "natural noise blockers". Trees not only absorb carbon dioxide, give shade, avoid soil erosion, but they also act as buffers and filter out the annoying urban noise.
             <br /> <br />
             The right bar chart shows complaints in the Mass Ave neighborhood about noise.

            <div class="title">Where more trees could be planted along Mass Ave</div>
            The right bar chart shows some of the area where work-hours-loud-noise complaints come.<br />
             Thus, we can plant more trees in Roxbury, Back Bay and South End.
